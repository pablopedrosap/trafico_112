- **AI Document Classification**: Uses Google Gemini Vision API to classify and extract data from medical documents
- **Intelligent Document Pairing**: Matches invoices (FAC) with medical records (EVO) based on patient data and dates
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple documents simultaneously with concurrent processing
- **Report Generation**: Creates Excel reports and CSV incident logs
- **Automated Response**: Sends organized ZIP files back to senders

### Document Types Supported
- **Invoices (FAC)**: Financial documents with patient billing information
- **Medical Records (EVO)**: Clinical evolution documents and patient records
- **Multi-format Support**: PDF, JPG, PNG files with OCR capabilities

## Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install google-generativeai pandas openpyxl PyMuPDF python-dotenv
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```env
# Email Configuration
IMAP_HOST=imap.your-email-provider.com
IMAP_USER=your-email@domain.com
IMAP_PASS=your-email-password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
SMTP_USER=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-email-password

# AI Configuration
GEMINI_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

# Storage Configuration
DATA_DIR=./data
```

## Usage

### Single Processing Run
```bash
python trafico_processor.py --once
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
python trafico_processor.py --loop
```
*Checks for new emails every 10 minutes*

## Key Components

### 1. Document Classification System
```python
async def classify_file(path: Path) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # AI-powered document analysis
    # Extracts: document type, patient name, DNI, episode number, date, amount
    # Returns structured JSON with confidence scores
```

### 2. Intelligent Pairing Algorithm
- **Patient Matching**: Groups documents by patient using name/DNI variations
- **Case Creation**: Associates related documents by date proximity (±3 days) and content similarity
- **LLM Integration**: Uses advanced language models for complex document relationships

### 3. Automated Report Generation
- **Master Excel File**: Comprehensive patient summary with totals and statistics
- **Incident Reports**: Detailed logs of unpaired documents and processing issues
- **ZIP Organization**: Patient-folder structure with date-based case grouping

### 4. Email Processing Pipeline
- **IMAP Monitoring**: Continuously checks for unseen emails with attachments
- **Attachment Processing**: Downloads and processes PDF/image attachments
- **Automated Response**: Sends organized results back to original sender

## Output Structure

### Excel Report Format
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Paciente | Patient name (canonical form) |
| DNI | Patient identification number |
| Num_Facturas | Number of invoices processed |
| Importe_Total | Total amount from all invoices |
| Num_Evolutivos | Number of medical records |
| Incidencias | Processing issues or "OK" |

### ZIP File Organization
```
